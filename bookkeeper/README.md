## Get Voters' Rewards by Delegate Name
Usage: `bookkeeper --bp BP_NAME --reward-address REWARD_ADDRESS --start START_EPOCH_NUM --end END_EPOCH_NUM --dist-percentage DIST_PERCENTAGE [--with-foundation-bonus] [--endpoint YOUR_ENDPOINT]`

Epoch Reward only
```
./bookkeeper --bp iotexbp --reward-address io1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --start 1 --end 10 --dist-percentage 77

## Send Out Voters' Rewards
The generated bytecode can be used by `ioctl` to actually send out the voters' rewards, i.e.,
```
ioctl action invoke io1sesxdghz93f4sadhu6a7242m22gphmc2aucz4g <total-amount> -l <gas-limit> -p <gas-price> -s <signer> -b <bytecode>`
```

Note that `io1sesxdghz93f4sadhu6a7242m22gphmc2aucz4g` is the pre-deployed contract for sending IOTX coins to multiple addresses.
